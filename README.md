This is our assignment for the Version Control skill lab in CMPINF 0010.

Our program will ask the user if they want a random number. If the user inputs a Y, they'll get a random number. If the user inputs an N, they'll get a prompt for one more confirmation. If the user replies with another N, the program will respond to the user and stop.
